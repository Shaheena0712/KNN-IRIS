The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing 150 flower samples equally distributed across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each flower is described using four numerical features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width — which are used to classify the species. With its balanced structure and clearly separable classes, the Iris dataset serves as an excellent benchmark for testing and evaluating classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression.

The Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, is one of the most popular and widely used datasets in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 flower samples, equally divided into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is described by four features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width — all measured in centimeters. While Setosa is easily distinguishable from the other species, Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap, making classification slightly more challenging and interesting. The dataset is perfectly balanced with 50 samples per class and is commonly used for multi-class classification problems. Because of its simplicity, clarity, and versatility, the Iris dataset has become a standard benchmark for testing and demonstrating algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, as well as for exploring data visualization, clustering, and dimensionality reduction techniques.
